ear2tap for esxdos
==================

Usage: .ear2tap file.tap

It creates new file file.tap and loads from the real tape (EAR socket). Similar in effect to the COPY-COPY program.
Green border means saving to a disk or a SD card. You can pause tape if the green border is shown longer.
Press BREAK when playing tape finished. It will restart Spectrum.

I successfully transferred a few tapes this way.
